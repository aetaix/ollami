# Ollami (WIP) 🖐️

> "Oh l'ami" - French for "Hi friend!"

Ollami is a frontend application designed to interact with local Ollama models for text generation, reasoning, chat and more.

## 🚀 Rebuilding Ollami with Svelte 5 and More

I'm excited to announce a major overhaul of the Ollami project! Since its inception, the tech landscape, especially in AI, has evolved significantly. With the release of Svelte 5, new AI SDKs, and a plethora of advanced models, it's time for Ollami to embrace these changes and step into a new era of innovation and stability.

### Why Rebuild?

After a thorough evaluation of all packages and technologies involved, I've concluded that a rebuild is the best path forward. This decision, though challenging and risky, is driven by my commitment to providing a stable, modern, and efficient platform. My goal is to retain the core essence of Ollami while significantly enhancing its capabilities and user experience.

### Core Principles

As I embark on this journey, I remain steadfast in my core principles:

- **Agnostic and Free Front End for Ollama**: Ensuring compatibility and freedom for all users.
- **Modern and Intuitive UI**: A sleek, user-friendly interface that enhances user interaction.
- **Ease of Use and Understanding**: Simplifying the user experience to make it accessible for everyone.
- **Ease of Contribution**: Encouraging community involvement and collaboration.
- **Simplified Deployment**: Making deployment easier, especially for non-developers.

**Why Use Ollami?** 💡

- Save time and resources by running your favorite models directly on your machine.
- Quickly access and interact with a wide range of models, available directly in the interface.
- Seamlessly test and evaluate local model performance in a real-world application context.
