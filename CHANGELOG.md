## ðŸš€ Rebuilding Ollami with Svelte 5 and More

I'm excited to announce a major overhaul of the Ollami project! Since its inception, the tech landscape, especially in AI, has evolved significantly. With the release of Svelte 5, new AI SDKs, and a plethora of advanced models, it's time for Ollami to embrace these changes and step into a new era of innovation and stability.

### Why Rebuild?

After a thorough evaluation of all packages and technologies involved, I've concluded that a rebuild is the best path forward. This decision, though challenging and risky, is driven by my commitment to providing a stable, modern, and efficient platform. My goal is to retain the core essence of Ollami while significantly enhancing its capabilities and user experience.

### Core Principles

As I embark on this journey, I remain steadfast in my core principles:

- **Agnostic and Free Front End for Ollama**: Ensuring compatibility and freedom for all users.
- **Modern and Intuitive UI**: A sleek, user-friendly interface that enhances user interaction.
- **Ease of Use and Understanding**: Simplifying the user experience to make it accessible for everyone.
- **Ease of Contribution**: Encouraging community involvement and collaboration.
- **Simplified Deployment**: Making deployment easier, especially for non-developers.

### Exciting New Features

In addition to my core principles, I am thrilled to introduce a range of new features that will elevate the Ollami experience:
